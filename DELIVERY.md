# Delivery

This project uses Chef Delivery for continuous delivery. When you create
a new feature and submit it for review, Delivery automatically runs
lightweight tests and allows your colleagues to review your change. Once
approved, your change will be deployed to an acceptance environment
where tests can run against a working stack.
